# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-AI
The "Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks" project aims to create a system that can automatically detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in real-time using computer vision techniques. Leveraging deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
